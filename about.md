I'm an Italian guy living in London passionated about everything involved into innovation, especially in the tech field. I have a master in Software Engineering and I'm really fond of learning, the best way we have to keep our brain active and rise from the ignorance ashes.

I decided to write this blog because I think sharing our knowledge is the best thing we can do to promote education. In this blog I'm going to write about the arguments that took me a while to figure out, with the hope to make it more clear and faster to learn for someone else. This won't be a scheduled blog but I'm going to expand it as long as I find something worthy in my path.
