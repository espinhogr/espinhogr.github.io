I'm an Italian guy living in London passionated about everything involved into innovation, especially in the tech field. I have a master in Software Engineering and I'm really fond of learning: the best way we have to keep our brain active and rise from the ignorance ashes.

I decided to write this blog because I think sharing our knowledge is the best thing we can do to promote education. In this blog I'm going to write mainly about the arguments that took me a while to figure out or I have experience with, hoping to make them more clear and easier to learn for someone else. This won't be a scheduled blog but I'm going to expand it as long as I find something worthy in my path.

This blog is not limited to my work experience, you could also find something related to my personal life, don't be scared ^\_^
